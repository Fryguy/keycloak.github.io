                <p class="blog-date">Monday, August 12 2019, posted by Sebastian Łaskaiwec</p>

                <div class="blog blog-container">

<p>
A few months back, we had a great article about clustering using <a href="http://jgroups.org/manual/#JDBC_PING">JDBC_PING</a> protocol. Since then, we introduced some improvements for the <a href="https://quay.io/repository/keycloak/keycloak?tab=tags">Keycloak container image</a> that can simplify the setup. So, before diving into this blog post, I highly encourage you to visit the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/05/keycloak-cluster-setup.html">Keycloak Cluster Setup</a> article.
</p>


<h2>What has changed in our Container Image?</h2>
<p>
Probably the most important change is configuring the JGroups discovery protocol by using variables (see the <a href="https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/keycloak/pull/151">Pull Request</a>). Once the change got in, we could configure the JGroups discovery by setting two properties:
<ul>
<li>JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL</li>
<li>JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROPERTIES</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Let's apply the changes, shall we...</h2>
<p>
The JDBC_PING-based setup works fine in all scenarios, where we connect all Keyclaok instances to the same database. Since JDBC_PING can be configured to obtain a database connection using JNDI binding, it can easily connect to the Keycloak database. All we need to do is to add two parameters to our docker image:
<ul>
<li>JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL=JDBC_PING</li>
<li>JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROPERTIES=datasource_jndi_name=java:jboss/datasources/KeycloakDS</li>
</ul>
</p>

You may find an end-to-end scenario <a href="https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/keycloak/pull/204">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Additional configuration</h2>
<p>
In some scenarios, you may need additional configuration. All additional settings might be added to the JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROPERTIES. Here are some hints and common problems, that you may find:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Problem description</td>
<td>Possible solution</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The initialization SQL needs to be adjusted</td>
<td>In this case, you might want to look at <tt>initialize_sql</tt> JDBC_PING property</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When Keycloak crashes, the database is not cleared</td>
<td>Turn <tt>remove_old_coords_on_view_change</tt> property on</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When Keycloak crashes, the database is not cleared</td>
<td>Also, when a cluster is not too large, you may turn the <tt>remove_all_data_on_view_change</tt> property on</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sometimes, Keycloak doesn't write its data into the database</td>
<td>You may lower the <tt>info_writer_sleep_time</tt> and <tt>info_writer_max_writes_after_view</tt> property values</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

                <h1><a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/05/keycloak-cluster-setup.html">Keycloak Cluster Setup</a></h1>

                <p class="blog-date">Friday, May 10 2019, posted by 张立强 liqiang@fit2cloud.com</p>

                <div class="blog blog-container">

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">This post shares some solutions to setup Keycloak cluster in various scenarios (e.g. cross-DC, docker cross-host, Kubernetes).</p>

<p>If you'd like to setup Keycloak cluster, this blog may give you some reference.</p>

<p>Two cli script files are added to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/keycloak/">Keycloak image</a> as per the <a href="https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/keycloak/blob/master/server/README.md#adding-custom-discovery-protocols">guide</a>.</p>

<p>The Dockerfile is below and these two files are the most important matter for this blog, you can find them from <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fit2anything/keycloak-cluster-setup-and-configuration/master/src/TCPPING.cli">TCPPING.cli</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fit2anything/keycloak-cluster-setup-and-configuration/master/src/JDBC_PING.cli">JDBC_PING.cli</a>.</p>

<pre>
FROM jboss/keycloak:latest

ADD cli/TCPPING.cli /opt/jboss/tools/cli/jgroups/discovery/
ADD cli/JDBC_PING.cli /opt/jboss/tools/cli/jgroups/discovery/
</pre>

<p>First of all we should know that for a Keycloak cluster, all keycloak instances should use same database and this is very simple, another thing is about cache(generally there are two kinds of cache in Keycloaks, the 1st is persistent data cache read from database aim to improve performance like realm/client/user, the 2nd is the non-persistent data cache like sessions/clientSessions, the 2nd is very important for a cluster) which is a little bit complex to configure, we have to make sure the consistent of cache in a cluster view.</p>

<p>Totally here are 3 solutions for clustering, and all of the solutions are base on the discovery protocols of <a href="http://jgroups.org/">JGroups</a> (Keycloak use <a href="http://infinispan.org/">Infinispan</a> cache and Infinispan use JGroups to discover nodes).</p>

<h3>1. PING</h3>
<p><a href="http://jgroups.org/manual/#PING">PING</a> is the default enabled clustering solution of Keycloak using UDP protocol, and you don't need to do any configuration for this.</p>
<p>But PING is only available when multicast network is enabled and port 55200 should be exposed, e.g. bare metals, VMs, docker containers in the same host.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/ping-deployment.jpg"/>
<p>We tested this by two Keycloak containers in same host.</p>
<p>The logs show that the two Keycloak instances discovered each other and clustered.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/ping-log.png"/>

<h3>2. TCPPING</h3>
<p><a href="http://jgroups.org/manual/#TCPPING_Prot">TCPPING</a> use TCP protocol with 7600 port. This can be used when multicast is not available, e.g. deployments cross DC, containers cross host.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/tcp-ping-deployment.jpg"/>
<p>We tested this by two Keycloak containers cross host.</p>
<p>And in this solution we need to set three below environment variables for containers.
<pre>
#IP address of this host, please make sure this IP can be accessed by the other Keycloak instances
JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_EXTERNAL_IP=172.21.48.39
#protocol
JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL=TCPPING
#IP and Port of all host
JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROPERTIES=initial_hosts="172.21.48.4[7600],172.21.48.39[7600]"
</pre>
</p>
<p>The logs show that the two Keycloak instances discovered each other and clustered.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/tcp-ping-log.png"/>

<h3>3. JDBC_PING</h3>
<p><a href="http://jgroups.org/manual/#_jdbc_ping">JDBC_PING</a> use TCP protocol with 7600 port which is similar as TCPPING, but the difference between them is, TCPPING requires you configure the IP and port of all instances,  for JDBC_PING you just need to configure the IP and port of current instance, this is because in JDBC_PING solution each instance insert its own information into database and the instances discover peers by the ping data read from database.</p>
<p>We tested this by two Keycloak containers cross host.</p>
<p>And in this solution we need to set two below environment variables for containers.
<pre>
#IP address of this host, please make sure this IP can be accessed by the other Keycloak instances
JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_EXTERNAL_IP=172.21.48.39
#protocol
JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL=JDBC_PING
</pre>
</p>
<p>The ping data of all instances haven been saved in database after instances started.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/jdbc-ping-data.png"/>
<p>The logs show that the two Keycloak instances discovered each other and clustered.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/jdbc-ping-log.png"/>

<h3>One more thing</h3>
<p>The above solutions are available for most scenarios, but they are still not enough for some others, e.g.Kubernetes.</p>
<p>The typical deployment on Kubernetes is one Deployment/ReplicateSet/StatefulSet contains multi Keycloak Pods, the Pods are really dynamic as they can scale up and down or failover to another node, which requires the cluster to discover and remove these dynamic members.</p>
<p>On Kubernetes we can use <a href="https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/keycloak/blob/master/server/README.md#openshift-example-with-dnsdns_ping">DNS_PING</a> or <a href="http://jgroups.org/manual/#_kube_ping">KUBE_PING</a> which work quite well in  <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/keycloak/templates/statefulset.yaml#L92">practice</a>. </p>
<p>Besides DNS_PING and KUBE_PING, JDBC_PING is another option for Kubernetes. </p>
<p>On Kubernetes multicast is available only for the containers in the same node and a pod has no static ip which can be used to configure TCPPING or JDBC_PING. But in the JDBC_PING.cli mentioned above we have handled this, if you don't set the JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_EXTERNAL_IP env, the pod ip will be used, that means on Kubernetes you can simply set JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL=JDBC_PING then your keycloak cluster is ok.</p>

We have a lot of news to share in this second edition, so fasten your seatbelt and let's go!
</p>


<h2>News from the community</h2>
<p>
First of all, we would like to thank the whole community, which has contributed to this edition by sharing their links, tips, and so on.
</p>
<p>
  An increasing number of API Management/Gateway solutions can now be integrated with Keycloak. Recently, <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/">Ambassador</a>, an Open Source Kubernetes-Native API Gateway built on the Envoy Proxy, has added <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/reference/idp-support/keycloak/">support for Keycloak</a>; it has also published a <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/tutorials/github-sso/">quickstart</a> to show how Keycloak can be used to add Github as Identity provider.   
</p>
<p>
We have some good news for Python users. Akhil Lawrence has created a <a href="https://github.com/akhilputhiry/keycloak-client/releases">Python Keycloak Adapter Client</a>. Be sure to check out the really nice <a href="https://keycloak-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a> that comes with many usage examples.  
</p>
<p>
Like any other project, setting up clustering can be somehow complex. Liqiang has shared with us his <a href="https://github.com/fit2anything/keycloak-cluster-setup-and-configuration">setup and configuration tips</a>. Thanks again for sharing your knowledge with the community!
</p>
<P>
The existing <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/keycloak">Keycloak Helm Chart</a> has now been deprecated and is now replaced by the <a href="https://github.com/codecentric/helm-charts">one</a> managed by CodeCentric.
</p>
<p>
Dmitry Telegin has created a really nice example on how you can dynamically brand your login theme for Keycloak. Check out the repository <a href="https://github.com/dteleguin/keycloak-dynamic-branding">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Hayri Cicek has written a nice introductory <a href="https://kodnito.com/posts/microprofile-jwt-with-keycloak/">article</a> on how to use Keycloak and MicroProfile. It even shows the usage of the brand new Client Scope "microprofile-jwt," which has been added in Keycloak 6.0.0.
</p>


<h2>News from the project</h2>
<p>
Keycloak 6.0.1 has been <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/04/keycloak-601-released.html">released</a>. We know that some people were a bit confused by our new versioning schema. We hope that this <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/04/versioning.html">blog post</a> will clear it up. 
</p>
<p>
We started the proposal process for Keycloak to be accepted into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). We hope that this effort will significantly boost our community adoption with our ultimate goal of becoming the de facto solution for OAuth2/OpenID Connect within Open Source and Cloud Native.
You can watch the presentation to the CNCF TOC (Technical Oversight Committee) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBrmcH9VFYE&feature=youtu.be&t=1032">here</a> and the slides are also available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bijEpuwaaa6jR1D5PAjyW731-j6Xc1TFHJuUh_FwwK8/edit?ts=5ca774e9#slide=id.g5628e016b1_15_112">here</a>.   
<p>
As mentioned in the previous newsletter, we will now discuss larger features openly on Github. It's community-focused and we have currently two open Pull Requests:

                <h1><a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/04/versioning.html">Keycloak Releases and Versioning</a></h1>

                <p class="blog-date">Wednesday, April 24 2019, posted by Stian Thorgersen</p>

                <div class="blog blog-container">

<p>
We are aiming to achieve a continuous delivery model with Keycloak. By that we mean it should be seamless to upgrade
between Keycloak releases and to keep up to date with the latest release.
</p>

<p>
This requires no breaking changes, but rather deprecating old APIs allowing time to migrate to new APIs.
</p>

<p>
Traditional semantic versioning does not fit very well with this model. By following the mantra of continuous delivery
we would forever be stuck on a major version and only update the minor version, and you could argue whether or not it
would be correct to update the major version when an API that has been deprecated for a long period of time is removed.
</p>

<p>
With this in mind, we have made some slight changes to our release cadence and versioning schema.
</p>

<p>
For now, we will have a new feature release roughly 4 times each year. Each release will bump the major version number.
That doesn't mean there are breaking changes, but until we perfect our continuous delivery model there may be some, so
always refer to the migration guide prior to upgrading!
</p>

<p>
We have also decided to drop the Final suffix from releases. That is simply because it is not needed as we have not done
any beta or release candidates for a long time. In the spirit of continuous delivery, we will have individual features
marked as preview rather than whole releases.
</p>

<p>
As a final note, with the reduced release cadence we are planning to do more micro releases. This will be focused on
critical bugs and security vulnerabilities. However, we may accept contributions to less critical bugs given the fix
is well tested and has low risk of regressions.
