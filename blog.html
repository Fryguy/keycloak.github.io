<p>
A lot of news to share in this second edition, so fasten your seatbelt and let's go ! 
</p>


<h2>News from the community</h2>
<p>
First of all, we would like to thank the whole community that has contributed to this edition by sharing their links, tips, etc ...
</p>
<p>
More and more API Management/Gateway solutions can now be integrated with Keycloak. Recently, <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/">Ambassador</a>, a Open Source Kubernetes-Native API Gateway built on the Envoy Proxy has added <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/reference/idp-support/keycloak/">support for Keycloak</a>, it has also published a <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/tutorials/github-sso/">quickstart</a> to show how Keycloak can be used to add Github as Identity provider.   
</p>
<p>
Good news for Python users, Akhil Lawrence has created a <a href="https://github.com/akhilputhiry/keycloak-client/releases">Python Keycloak Adapter Client</a>. Be sure to check out the really nice <a href="https://keycloak-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a> that comes with a lot of usage examples.  
</p>
<p>
Like any other project, setting up clustering can be somehow complex. Liqiang has shared with us his <a href="https://github.com/fit2anything/keycloak-cluster-setup-and-configuration">setup and configuration tips</a> , thanks again for sharing your knwoledge with the community ! 
</p>
<P>
The existing <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/keycloak">Keycloak Helm Chart</a> has now been deprecated and is now replaced by the <a href="https://github.com/codecentric/helm-charts">one</a> managed by CodeCentric.
</p>
<p>
Dmitry Telegin has created a really nice example on how you can dynamically brand your login them for Keycloak, check out the repository <a href="https://github.com/dteleguin/keycloak-dynamic-branding">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Hayri Cicek has written a nice introductory <a href="https://kodnito.com/posts/microprofile-jwt-with-keycloak/">article</a> on how to use Keycloak and MicroProfile. It even show the usage of the brand new Client Scope "microprofile-jwt" which has been added in Keycloak 6.0.0.
</p>


<h2>News from the project</h2>
<p>
Keycloak 6.0.1 has been <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/04/keycloak-601-released.html">released</a>. We know that some people were a bit confused by our new versioning schema, hopefully, this <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/04/versioning.html">blog post</a> will clear it up. 
</p>
<p>
We started the proposal process for Keycloak to be accepted into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). This will hopefully significantly boost our community adoption with our ultimate goal of becoming the de facto solution for OAuth2/OpenID Connect within Open Source and Cloud Native.
You can watch the presentation to the CNCF TOC (Technical Oversight Committee) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBrmcH9VFYE&feature=youtu.be&t=1032">here</a> and the slides are also available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bijEpuwaaa6jR1D5PAjyW731-j6Xc1TFHJuUh_FwwK8/edit?ts=5ca774e9#slide=id.g5628e016b1_15_112">here</a>.   
<p>
As mentioned in the previous newsletter, larger feature will now be discussed in the open on Github. It's community focused and we have currently 2 open Pull Requests :
<ul>
<li>
 <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/pull/5">Managing multi-factor authentication and Step-up authentication</a>
</li>
<li>
 <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/pull/6">Implementation of OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant</a> 
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Conferences / Webinars</h2>

                <h1><a href="2019/04/versioning.html">Keycloak Releases and Versioning</a></h1>

                <p class="blog-date">Wednesday, April 24 2019, posted by Stian Thorgersen</p>

                <div class="blog blog-container">

<p>
We are aiming to achieve a continuous delivery model with Keycloak. By that we mean it should be seamless to upgrade
between Keycloak releases and to keep up to date with the latest release.
</p>

<p>
This requires no breaking changes, but rather deprecating old APIs allowing time to migrate to new APIs.
</p>

<p>
Traditional semantic versioning does not fit very well with this model. By following the mantra of continuous delivery
we would forever be stuck on a major version and only update the minor version, and you could argue whether or not it
would be correct to update the major version when an API that has been deprecated for a long period of time is removed.
</p>

<p>
With this in mind, we have made some slight changes to our release cadence and versioning schema.
</p>

<p>
For now, we will have a new feature release roughly 4 times each year. Each release will bump the major version number.
That doesn't mean there are breaking changes, but until we perfect our continuous delivery model there may be some, so
always refer to the migration guide prior to upgrading!
</p>

<p>
We have also decided to drop the Final suffix from releases. That is simply because it is not needed as we have not done
any beta or release candidates for a long time. In the spirit of continuous delivery, we will have individual features
marked as preview rather than whole releases.
</p>

<p>
As a final note, with the reduced release cadence we are planning to do more micro releases. This will be focused on
critical bugs and security vulnerabilities. However, we may accept contributions to less critical bugs given the fix
is well tested and has low risk of regressions.

<p>
This is the very first "Keycloak Community Newsletter." The goal of this newsletter is to share news about the Keycloak project.
</p>


<h2>News from the community</h2>
<p>
Since the beginning of the year, the community has been really active. Each week several blog posts about Keycloak are published. Here is a short selection.
</p>
<p>
Let's start with Philip Riecks who explains in <a href="https://rieckpil.de/howto-microprofile-jwt-authentication-with-keycloak-and-react/">this article</a> how you can use Microprofile JWT Authentication with Keycloak and React.
</p>
<p>
Ramandeep Singh has been <a href="https://medium.com/@ramandeep.singh.1983/enterprise-web-app-authentication-using-keycloak-and-node-js-c10b0e26b80d">blogging</a> about Keycloak and NodeJS.
</p>
<p>
Joshua Alfred Erney explains in this <a href="https://www.jerney.io/secure-apis-kong-keycloak-1/">blog series</a> how to integrate Keycloak and <a href="https://konghq.com/">Kong</a>, a popular API management platform.
</p>
<P>
With Mohamed Aboullaite's blog post, you will learn how to <a href="https://aboullaite.me/secure-kibana-keycloak/">secure your Kibana dashboards using Keycloak</a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally in <a href=https://beyondthekube.com/identity-management-for-on-prem-clusters/?utm_sq=g0u3m590zf">this three-part article</a>, the process of installing Keycloak on Kubernetes will become very clear.
</p>


<h2>News from the project</h2>
<p>
Keycloak 5.0.0 has been <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/03/keycloak-500-released.html">released</a> and 6.0.0 is around the corner.
</p>
<p>
From now on, new larger Keycloak's features will be openly discussed. For each new feature, a design document will be created and pushed to our Github repository as a simple MarkDown file. This strategy makes it easy for everyone to comment as well as contribute to the designs by opening Github issues and providing pull requests.
We have already three documents open for discussion:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/blob/master/design/web-authn-two-factor.md">W3C Web Authentication - Two-Factor</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/blob/master/design/application-initiated-actions.md">Application-Initiated Actions</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/blob/master/design/observerability.md">Observerability</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>News from the Identity Management World</h2>
<p>
The big announcement, two weeks ago, was that <a href="https://www.yubico.com/webauthn/">WebAuthn<a/> became an official W3C Standard. This event is a milestone in the world of authentication and Identity Management. The goal of WebAuthn, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn">Wikipedia</a> is to: <i> standardize an interface for public-key authentication of users to web-based applications and services.</i>
The Keycloak community is naturally really interested in this new standard. A design document is <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/blob/master/design/web-authn-two-factor.md">available</a> and the community has even started to work on a <a href="https://github.com/webauthn4j/keycloak-webauthn-authenticator">prototype</a>.
</p>


<h2>Conferences / Webinars</h2>
<p>
In March, the Javaland conference was held in Germany. The conference had two talks about Keycloak. Sébastien blanc gave a talk about <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSp6t8vo1LsWBVDmFmFVC43qtwSQK3_UrVfFIQcTpaEmGJohHbwsKj9UYUEZdogRMXWMMJJSskWRHyZ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000">Securing your Microservices with Keycloak</a>. A Github repository contains the <a href="https://github.com/sebastienblanc/quarkus-quickstart">demo</a>. Thomas Darimont also gave an <a href="https://www.javaland.eu/formes/pubfiles/11145218/2019-nn-thomas_darimont-sichere_spring-anwendungen_mit_keycloak-praesentation.pdf">introductory talk</a> in German about Keycloak.
<p>
<p>
In April, at Devoxx France, Guillaume Gillon will talk in French about how to combine <a href="https://cfp.devoxx.fr/2019/talk/BIP-1027/L'open-source_a_la_rescousse_de_mes_APIS:_comment_les_securiser_grace_a_Gravitee.io_et_Keycloak">Keycloak and Gravitee.io</a>.

                <h1><a href="2019/03/web-authn.html">W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn)</a></h1>

                <p class="blog-date">Wednesday, March 06 2019, posted by Stian Thorgersen</p>

                <div class="blog blog-container">

<p>
W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) was recently made an official web standard. This is a great step towards making a safer and
simpler authentication experience for users.
</p>

<p>
Where traditional authentication, such as password and OTP, rely on having shared secrets between the user and the
web application, this is not the case with WebAuthn. WebAuthn uses public key-based credentials resulting in the web
application not having access to the users secrets anymore. The keys are also unique per web application which eliminates
the risk of phishing attacks.
</p>

<p>
WebAuthn provides a standard protocol for web applications to authenticate via a number of devices through a relatively
simple challenge/response. All major browser vendors now have support for WebAuthn and FIDO2, where FIDO2 is the specification
that enables the browser to communicate with different hardware devices.
</p>

<p>
WebAuthn can be used both as a two factor mechanism as well as enable passwordless authentication. There are already
an healthy amount of devices that can be used together with WebAuthn. There are a number of security keys like
<a href="https://www.yubico.com/">YubiKey</a>, <a href="https://thinc.ensurity.com/">ThinC</a> and
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key/">Titan</a>. A lot of new laptops also come with built-in
fingerprint scanners, and it Android also recently made it possible to use the fingerprint scanners on Android 7+ devices with WebAuthn.
</p>

<p>
We are of course planning on bringing WebAuthn support to Keycloak in the near future. The team behind <a href="https://github.com/webauthn4j/webauthn4j">webauthn4j</a>
has been hard at work greating a quality Java library for WebAuthn and will hopefully soon have an extension to
Keycloak ready.
</p>

<p>
We will first focus on two-factor authentication with WebAuth and as part of this we will bring a number of improvements
to Keycloak around two-factor authentication. For more details check the
<a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/blob/master/design/web-authn-two-factor.md">design document</a>.
</p>

<p>
Later, we will also bring the passwordless experience to Keycloak. This will also introduce Keycloak to the identity
first login flows. By asking for the users identity first Keycloak can provide smarter decisions on how to authenticate
a user based on the users preferences. For example requesting the user to press the button on their security key instead
of asking for a password.
